üöÄ SubTrack - Subscription Manager
A simple yet powerful web application to track all your subscriptions, free trials, and recurring payments. Never get charged unexpectedly again!

üéØ About The Project
This project was built to solve a common problem: forgetting to cancel free trials before they convert to paid subscriptions. SubTrack provides a clean dashboard to see all upcoming billing dates and highlights subscriptions that need immediate attention.

The application is built with a modern Java stack and follows an iterative development process, starting with an in-memory data store and evolving towards a full-fledged database-backed application.
